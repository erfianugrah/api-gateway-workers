# Key Manager Workers Implementation

This document describes the implementation details of the enhanced key manager features.

## Features Added

1. **Key Rotation with Grace Periods**
   - Added ability to rotate API keys while maintaining a grace period for the old key
   - Implemented `rotateKey` method in the `ApiKeyManager` class
   - Added `POST /keys/:id/rotate` endpoint

2. **HMAC Signature Verification**
   - Added HMAC-based signatures for API keys for enhanced security
   - Implemented in `generateHmac` and `verifyHmac` functions
   - Integrated into key validation flow

3. **Encryption at Rest**
   - Implemented AES-GCM encryption for API key material
   - Added versioning for future encryption algorithm changes
   - Secured with environment-based encryption keys

4. **Cursor-based Pagination**
   - Added efficient cursor-based pagination for listing API keys
   - Implemented `listKeysWithCursor` method
   - Added `/keys-cursor` endpoint

5. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Added transaction support for atomicity
   - Implemented retry logic for critical operations
   - Better error reporting

## Implementation Details

### Key Rotation

The key rotation feature works as follows:

1. When a key is rotated:
   - A new API key is created with the same properties (or updated properties if provided)
   - The original key is marked as "rotated" and linked to the new key
   - A rotation record is created with the grace period end timestamp

2. During the grace period:
   - Both the old and new keys will validate successfully
   - The old key will include a warning message about the rotation
   - Applications can seamlessly migrate to the new key

3. After the grace period:
   - The old key will no longer validate
   - Rotation records are automatically cleaned up

### Encryption and HMAC

The security implementation includes:

1. Encryption at Rest:
   - Uses AES-GCM encryption for sensitive key material
   - Requires an `ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable
   - Keys are only ever sent in plaintext at creation time

2. HMAC Signatures:
   - Every key gets an HMAC signature based on its ID
   - Signatures are verified during validation
   - Adds an extra layer of security against forged keys

### Cursor-based Pagination

The cursor pagination implementation:

1. Uses efficient index entries for pagination
2. Returns a cursor that can be used to fetch the next page
3. Scales efficiently with large datasets
4. Maintains backward compatibility with offset-based pagination

## Testing

The code has been tested with unit tests covering the core functionality. Some tests need adjustments due to the addition of WebCrypto dependencies:

1. **Mocking WebCrypto**: For proper testing, the WebCrypto API should be mocked. This has been partially implemented but would need to be completed for a production deployment.

2. **Test Environment**: In a production environment, you would:
   - Set up environment variables for `ENCRYPTION_KEY` and `HMAC_SECRET`
   - Create proper test fixtures for WebCrypto
   - Update the test suite to work with the new security features

### Recommendations for Testing

Before deploying to production:

1. Set up proper WebCrypto mocks for testing
2. Complete the test coverage for the new features
3. Add integration tests for key rotation
4. Set up performance tests for cursor-based pagination

## Configuration

The following environment variables should be set:

- `ENCRYPTION_KEY`: Secret key for encrypting API keys at rest
- `HMAC_SECRET`: Secret for generating HMAC signatures

## Future Improvements

1. Add full key material rotation (re-encrypt all keys)
2. Implement key hierarchies and delegated permissions
3. Add webhook notifications for key lifecycle events
4. Improve caching for frequently validated keys
