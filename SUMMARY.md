# API Gateway Improvements

## API Gateway Features

1. **Enhanced Routing**
   - Implemented regex pattern matching for flexible routes
   - Added path parameter validation with configurable patterns
   - Added API versioning with configuration-driven support
   - Implemented priority-based route matching

2. **Proxy Capabilities**
   - Implemented request forwarding to upstream services
   - Added path rewriting and transformation
   - Implemented header manipulation at multiple levels
   - Added circuit breaker pattern for fault tolerance
   - Implemented retry mechanism with exponential backoff

3. **Configuration System**
   - Implemented OpenAPI schema-validated configuration
   - Added configuration loading from files and environment variables
   - Created hierarchical configuration with dot notation access
   - Added configuration priority system with sensible defaults

## Security Enhancements

1. **Key Encryption at Rest**
   - Implemented AES-GCM encryption for storing API keys securely
   - Added version field to support future encryption algorithm changes
   - Separated plaintext keys from storage, only returning to clients on creation

2. **HMAC Signature Verification**
   - Added HMAC signatures for API keys for additional security
   - Implemented verification during key validation
   - Prevents key forgery even if database is compromised

3. **Improved Validation**
   - Enhanced API key format validation with regex patterns
   - Better error handling and reporting

## Feature Additions

1. **Key Rotation**
   - Implemented API key rotation with grace periods
   - Allows seamless migration from old keys to new keys
   - Configurable grace period (default 30 days)
   - Old keys continue to work during grace period with warning

2. **Cursor-based Pagination**
   - Added more efficient pagination using cursors
   - Better performance for large datasets
   - Maintains backward compatibility with offset-based pagination

3. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Added transaction support for atomic operations
   - Implemented retry logic for critical operations
   - Better error reporting and recovery

## Performance Improvements

1. **Transaction Support**
   - Batched operations for better performance
   - Atomic operations to prevent data consistency issues

2. **Optimized Storage**
   - Added index entries for faster querying
   - More efficient storage patterns

3. **Fault Tolerance**
   - Implemented circuit breaker to prevent cascading failures
   - Added configurable retries with exponential backoff
   - Enhanced timeout management with request cancellation

## Observability

1. **Enhanced Cleanup**
   - Improved expired key cleanup
   - Added rotation tracking
   - Better cleanup reporting

2. **Structured Logging**
   - Implemented structured JSON logging
   - Added configurable logging levels
   - Added request context to error logs

## Testing

1. **Comprehensive Test Coverage**
   - Tests for all command objects and handlers
   - Tests for proxy functionality and circuit breaker
   - Tests for API versioning and routing
   - Tests for configuration system

## Implementation Details

The implementation includes:

- Clean architecture with distinct layers
- Command pattern for business logic encapsulation
- Core encryption utility using WebCrypto API
- HMAC signature generation and verification
- Transaction-based storage operations
- Proxy service with circuit breaker pattern
- Enhanced routing with regex pattern support
- Comprehensive configuration system

## Environment Configuration

Configuration options include:
- `encryption.key`: Secret key for encrypting API keys
- `hmac.secret`: Secret for HMAC signature generation
- `proxy.enabled`: Enable/disable proxy functionality
- `proxy.timeout`: Default timeout for proxied requests
- `proxy.retry.enabled`: Enable/disable retry mechanism
- `proxy.circuitBreaker.enabled`: Enable/disable circuit breaker
- `routing.versioning.enabled`: Enable/disable API versioning

These changes transform the project from a simple key manager to a full-featured API gateway built on Cloudflare Workers while maintaining backward compatibility.
