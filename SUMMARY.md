# Key Manager Workers Improvements

## Security Enhancements

1. **Key Encryption at Rest**
   - Implemented AES-GCM encryption for storing API keys securely
   - Added version field to support future encryption algorithm changes
   - Separated plaintext keys from storage, only returning to clients on creation

2. **HMAC Signature Verification**
   - Added HMAC signatures for API keys for additional security
   - Implemented verification during key validation
   - Prevents key forgery even if database is compromised

3. **Improved Validation**
   - Enhanced API key format validation with regex patterns
   - Better error handling and reporting

## Feature Additions

1. **Key Rotation**
   - Implemented API key rotation with grace periods
   - Allows seamless migration from old keys to new keys
   - Configurable grace period (default 30 days)
   - Old keys continue to work during grace period with warning

2. **Cursor-based Pagination**
   - Added more efficient pagination using cursors
   - Better performance for large datasets
   - Maintains backward compatibility with offset-based pagination

3. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Added transaction support for atomic operations
   - Implemented retry logic for critical operations
   - Better error reporting and recovery

## Performance Improvements

1. **Transaction Support**
   - Batched operations for better performance
   - Atomic operations to prevent data consistency issues

2. **Optimized Storage**
   - Added index entries for faster querying
   - More efficient storage patterns

## Observability

1. **Enhanced Cleanup**
   - Improved expired key cleanup
   - Added rotation tracking
   - Better cleanup reporting

## Testing

1. **Added Unit Tests**
   - Tests for key rotation
   - Tests for cursor-based pagination
   - Validation tests for new features

## Implementation Details

The implementation includes:

- Core encryption utility using WebCrypto API
- HMAC signature generation and verification
- Transaction-based storage operations
- Graceful handling of key rotation
- Efficient cursor-based pagination
- Backward compatibility with existing APIs

## Environment Configuration

New environment variables:
- `ENCRYPTION_KEY`: Secret key for encrypting API keys
- `HMAC_SECRET`: Secret for HMAC signature generation

These changes significantly improve the security and functionality of the key manager while maintaining backward compatibility.
