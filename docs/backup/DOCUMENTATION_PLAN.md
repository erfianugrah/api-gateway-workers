# Documentation Reorganization Plan

This plan outlines a comprehensive reorganization of the API Gateway Workers documentation to reduce duplication, improve navigation, and create a more maintainable documentation structure.

## Goals

1. Eliminate content duplication across documents
2. Create a logical organization structure
3. Standardize file naming conventions
4. Improve cross-references between documents
5. Make documentation more navigable with clear entry points
6. Ensure each document has a clear, focused purpose

## File Naming Convention

All documentation files will follow these conventions:
- Use lowercase with hyphens for filenames (e.g., `quick-start.md` instead of `QUICKSTART.md`)
- Use descriptive, concise names
- Group related files in appropriate directories

## New Directory Structure

```

## Consolidation Plan

### 1. Top-Level Project Files

## Implementation Approach

1. **Create Archive**: First, create an archive of all existing documentation before making changes
2. **Create Directory Structure**: Set up the new directory structure
3. **Implement "Low-Hanging Fruit"**: Start with simple moves that require minimal content changes 
4. **Tackle Major Consolidations**: Address files with significant duplication
5. **Update References**: Ensure all cross-references are updated to point to new file locations
6. **Update Root README**: Update the project README.md with links to the new documentation structure
7. **Create Documentation Hub**: Create a new docs/README.md that serves as a documentation entry point

## Documentation Hub

The new `docs/README.md` will serve as a central navigation point with:

- Overview of available documentation
- Links to different documentation sections
- Reading guide for different audiences (new users, integrators, contributors)
- Search functionality if possible

## Cross-Referencing Strategy

For improved navigation:

1. Each document will start with links to related documents
2. Use relative links between documents for ease of maintenance
3. Include "next steps" suggestions at the end of guides
4. Create a breadcrumb-style navigation header in each file
