# Documentation Reorganization

## Overview

The API Gateway Workers documentation has been reorganized to improve usability, reduce duplication, and create a more maintainable structure. This document summarizes the changes made and how to navigate the new documentation.

## Key Changes

1. **New Directory Structure**:
   - `/docs/guides/` - User-focused guides
   - `/docs/reference/` - Technical reference documentation
   - `/docs/architecture/` - Architecture and design documentation
   - `/docs/development/` - Documentation for contributors

2. **Consolidated Documentation**:
   - Eliminated duplicate content across multiple files
   - Combined related documentation into single, comprehensive files
   - Reorganized content into logical sections

3. **Improved Navigation**:
   - Added a documentation hub (docs/README.md)
   - Created clear pathways for different user personas
   - Added documentation structure guide
   - Added README files to each directory

4. **Standardized Naming**:
   - Consistent file naming with lowercase and hyphens
   - Clear, descriptive file names

## Navigating the New Documentation

Start at the [Documentation Hub](README.md) for an overview of all available documentation.

For information about how the documentation is structured, see the [Documentation Structure](documentation-structure.md) guide.

## Previous Documentation Location

The original documentation files have been preserved in the `/docs/archive/old-files/` directory for reference.

## Documentation Update Status

The documentation reorganization is complete, with:

- Core architecture documentation consolidated
- Configuration documentation reorganized
- Testing documentation consolidated
- API Gateway documentation enhanced
- Development roadmap updated

## Link Updates

A script has been provided (`update-links.sh`) to update all cross-references in the documentation to point to the new file locations.

## Benefits of the New Structure

- **Less Duplication**: Eliminated redundant content
- **Better Organization**: Clear location for each type of documentation
- **Improved Maintenance**: Easier to keep documentation up-to-date
- **Enhanced Navigation**: Clear pathways through documentation
- **Better User Experience**: Documentation targeted to different user types
